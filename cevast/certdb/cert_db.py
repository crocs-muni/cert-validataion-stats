"""
This module provides interface of CertDB class

    CertDB is a database of X.509 certificates implemented as transaction
    processing system with a common API (insert, remove, commit, rollback).

    Each certificate is uniquelly identified by its ID (fingerprint).
    A certificate is internally handled as string -> PEM format expected.

    It is expected that certificate's ID is uniquely matching the certificate in the world
    as a fingerprint should be used as ID. Therefore, inserting different certificate
    under same ID does not lead to rewriting the original certificate. To replace
    a specific certificate, it must first be deleted and then re-inserted - it can
    be performed in a single transaction as long as the sequence is preserved.

    Be aware that DELETE metod is deleting not persisted certificate immediatelly but
    the persisted one remains untill the transaction is committed. Therefore, methods like
    GET/EXPORT/EXISTS will not find not persisted deleted certificate.
