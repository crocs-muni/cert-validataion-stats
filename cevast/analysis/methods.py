"""
This module provides various certificate validation methods.

.. important::
   Each method accepts a single argument -- list with cetificates file paths.
   List should start with server certificate, followed by intermediates certificates
   and end with trusted CA certificate.

To add an additional validation method, register the method under its name to global
variable METHODS in 'MODULE INITIALIZATION' section.

Module can be imported and used as a library. Import-safe functions should be used
to get validation method by name or get all the available methods:
  - show()     - return tuple with all available method names
  - get_all()  - return tuple with all available methods
  - get(name)  - return methody with given name

Module can also be run as a standalone script with following usage:
    python3 ./methods           - prints all available method names
    python3 ./methods c1 c2 cN  - prints validation results from all available methods,
                                  args c1-cN are provided to validation method as a chain that
                                  starts with server certificate and ends with CA

.. todo::
   Maybe would be better to analyse the certs before validation to identify CAs
   and intermediates (validation would be better then)
