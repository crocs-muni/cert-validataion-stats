    An abstract DatasetManager class representing an interface that can be used to perform
    various tasks with a certificate dataset.

    For Manager to perform a task, a repository path and date must be provided. Date works
    as an identifier of the dataset even though the date don't need to match exactly
     - the newest dataset by that date is identified. Additionally a port number might be
    used to more specify the dataset.

    DatasetManager offers performing tasks independently or running a series of tasks at once
    by `run` method (usefull for performing tasks that would be rather complex and/or long-lasting
    running separatelly). Running a series might also be more optimized.
