Installation
------------

#### Requirements

* python3.6+
* everything listed in _requirements.txt_

You can install Cevast as follows:

    git clone https://github.com/crocs-muni/cert-validation-stats
    cd cert-validation-stats
    pip3 install --quiet -r requirements.txt
    make install

or without `make` tool on the system, equivalently using python:

    python3 setup.py install

Running above commands installs Cevast to your system as a runnable python package. You can then import
and use `cevast` modules in your own applications or run `cevast` command in your terminal to invoke
command line interface. Run either `cevast --help` or see the [cli documentation](https://crocs-muni.github.io/cert-validation-stats/cli.html)
for more information about using Cevast.

Depending on your OS, you might require root permissions to install Cevast to a system directory as by default.
Without having the permissions, you can install Cevast in your home directory instead:

    make user_install

or

    python3 setup.py install --user

and correspondingly the requirements:

    pip3 install --quiet -r requirements.txt --user

You can verify that Cevast is running correctly in your environment by executing unit tests as follows:

    make test

Developing
----------

As only a single developer is working on the project at the moment, only master (eh, sorry... main) branch is used.

#### Continuous Integration
CI is set up with use of [GitHub Actions workflow](https://github.com/crocs-muni/cert-validation-stats/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Python+application%22).
CI workflow runs unit tests and lint the code.

#### Testing
Tests are located in `tests/` and can be executed by running `unittest` via `make` target:

    make test

#### Code style
Code should follow coding conventions of standard __PEP 8__. Two linters are set up in CI build - [Pylint](https://www.pylint.org/) and [Flake8](https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8). There is a usefull `make` target for local linting (has the same set of settings as CI):

    make check

#### Documentation
Documentation is generated by [pdoc](https://pdoc3.github.io/pdoc/) to `docs/` directory. There is a usefull `make` target for that too:

    make docs

To not forget, you might be interested to set up git _pre-commit hook_ with following commands:

    make docs
    git add docs
